In total, we extracted usable detections for 37,965 objects. We present an examination of the reliability of the rotation period and light-curve amplitudes derived from each object based upon the number of detections and the normalized Lomb–Scargle power of our period fitting and compare and contrast our results with previous similar works. We show that for objects with 200 or more photometric detections and a derived normalized, generalized Lomb–Scargle power greater than 0.2, we have an 85% confidence in that period; this encompasses 3492 rotation periods we consider to be highly reliable. We independently examine a series of periods first reported by Pál et al.; periods derived in both works found to have similar results should be considered reliable. Additionally, we demonstrate the need to properly account for the true proportion of slow rotators ( P > 100 hr) when inferring shape distributions from sparse photometry.},

  abstract = { Compared with previous space-borne surveys, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) provides a unique and new approach to observe solar system objects. While its primary mission avoids the vicinity of the ecliptic plane by approximately six degrees, the scale height of the solar system debris disk is large enough to place various small body populations in the field of view. In this paper we present the first data release of photometric analysis of TESS observations of small solar system bodies, focusing on the bright end of the observed main-belt asteroid and Jovian Trojan populations. This data release, named TSSYS-DR1, contains 9912 light curves obtained and extracted in a homogeneous manner, and triples the number of bodies with unambiguous fundamental rotation characteristics, namely where accurate periods and amplitudes are both reported. Our catalog clearly shows that the number of bodies with long rotation periods are definitely underestimated by all previous ground-based surveys, by at least an order of magnitude. },

TESS image data can also serve as a valuable resource for asteroid and comet detection, including near-Earth objects (NEOs).

The LINEAR-TESS pipeline is currently in operation and reporting asteroid observations to the Minor Planet Center.

  abstract = {Deriving high quality lightcuves for asteroids and other periodic sources from survey data is challenging due to many factors, including the sparsely sampled observational record and diurnal aliasing which is a signature imparted into the periodic signal of a source that is a function of the observing schedule of ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining asteroid observational records from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) which are the ground- and space-based facilities, respectively, to determine to what degree the data from the space-based facility can suppress diurnal aliases. Furthermore, we examine several optimizations that are used to derive the rotation periods of asteroids which we then compare to the reported rotation periods in the literature. Through this analysis we find that we can reliably derive the rotation periods for ~85% of our sample of 222 objects that are also reported in the literature and that the remaining ~15% are difficult to reliably derive as many are asteroids that are insufficiently elongated which produces a lightcurve with an insufficient amplitude and consequently, an incorrect rotation period. We also investigate a binary classification method that biases against reporting incorrect rotation periods. We conclude the paper by assessing the utility of using other ground- or space-based facilities as companion telescopes to the forthcoming Rubin Observatory.},

  abstract  = {The search and detection of faint moving objects in image data can enable discoveries of small solar system bodies. To detect objects fainter than the single-frame sensitivity limit, track-before-detect methods can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the object of interest by incoherently adding the object’s signal across multiple frames. However, traditional track-before-detect techniques can become computationally intensive over large search volumes. In this work, we present a computational approach to significantly speed up the search process by applying dynamic-programming techniques to implement the discrete X-ray transform. In this approach, image frames are processed in stages, in each of which pairs of frames are shifted and added to generate short-track segments, which are combined in later stages to form longer tracks. The algorithm speedup comes from the fact that a single short track segment can be reused multiple times for different longer tracks without the need for recomputing. Benchmark testing with simulated data shows that the method presented in this paper results in a significant reduction in runtime in comparison to a traditional track-before-detect approach. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the applicability of the technique in performing a blind search for faint asteroids in image data collected from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, leading to the detection of more than a thousand asteroids below the single-frame detection limit with moderate computational resources. The approach presented in this work has the potential to enable efficient discovery of previously undetected faint solar system objects across multiple orbit classes.},

  abstract  = {We present results from a new pipeline custom-designed to search for faint, undiscovered solar system bodies using full-frame image data from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. This pipeline removes the baseline flux of each pixel before aligning and coadding frames along plausible orbital paths of interest. We first demonstrate the performance of the pipeline by recovering the signals of three trans-Neptunian objects - 90377 Sedna (V=20.64), 2015 BP519 (V=21.81), and 2007 TG422 (V=22.32) - both through shiftstacking along their known sky-projected paths and through a blind recovery. We then apply this blind-search procedure in a proof-of-concept survey of TESS Sectors 18 and 19, which extend through a portion of the Galactic plane in the Northern Hemisphere. We search for dim objects at geocentric distances d=70-800 au in a targeted search for Planet Nine and any previously unknown detached Kuiper Belt objects that may shed light on the Planet Nine hypothesis. With no input orbital information, our present pipeline can reliably recover the signals of distant solar system bodies in the Galactic plane with V<21 and current distances d ≤ 150 au, and we elaborate on paths forward to push these limits in future optimizations. The methods described in this paper will serve as a foundation for an all-sky shift-stacking survey of the distant solar system with TESS.},

  abstract = {The Main Belt asteroid (203) Pompeja shows evidence of extreme variability in visible and near-infrared spectral slope with time. The observed spectral variability has been hypothesized to be attributed to spatial variations across Pompeja's surface. In this scenario, the observed spectrum of Pompeja is dependent on the geometry of the Sun and the observer relative to the asteroid's spin pole and surface features. Knowledge of the rotational spin pole and shape can be gleaned from light curves and photometric measurements. However, dense light curves of Pompeja are only available from two apparitions. Further, previous estimates of Pompeja's sidereal period are close to being Earth-commensurate, making ground-based light curves difficult to obtain. To overcome these difficulties, we implement a pipeline to extract a dense light curve of Pompeja from cutouts of TESS Full Frame Images. We succeeded in obtaining a dense light curve of Pompeja covering $\sim$22 complete rotations. We measure a synodic period of $P_\{syn\} =24.092 \pm 0.005$ hours and amplitude of 0.073 $\pm$ 0.002 magnitudes during Pompeja's 2021 apparition in the TESS field of view. We use this light curve to refine models of Pompeja's shape and spin pole orientation, yielding two spin pole solutions with sidereal periods and spin pole ecliptic coordinates of $P_\{\mathrm\{sid\}, 1\} = 24.0485 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_1 = 132^\{\circ\}$, $\beta_1 = +41^\{\circ\}$ and $P_\{\mathrm\{sid\}, 2\} = 24.0484 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_2 =307^\{\circ\}$, $\beta_2 =+34^\{\circ\}$. Finally, we discuss the implications of the derived shape and spin models for spectral variability on Pompeja.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the distribution of asteroid spin rates vs. size. The existence of significant populations of both slow and fast rotators among asteroids smaller than D=40 km, and especially below 10 km (where our sample is mostly near-Earth asteroids), is shown. We have found that the excess of slow rotators is present at spin rates below ≈0.8 rev/day, and the group of fast rotators occupies the range of spin rates >7 rev/day. The fast rotators show interesting characteristics: The lack of objects rotating faster than 2.2 h period among asteroids with absolute magnitude H<22, as well as the tendency to spheroidal shapes of fast rotators, is evidence that asteroids larger than a few hundred meters are mostly loosely bound, gravity-dominated aggregates with negligible tensile strength ("rubble piles"), while monoliths may be abundant among smaller objects.

  abstract = {We present an empirical analysis of data structures for approximate nearest neighbor searching. We compare the well-known optimized kd-tree splitting method against two alternative splitting methods. The first, called the sliding-midpoint method, which attempts to balance the goals of producing subdivision cells of bounded aspect ratio, while not producing any empty cells. The second, called the minimum-ambiguity method is a query-based approach. In addition to the data points, it is also given a training set of query points for preprocessing. It employs a simple greedy algorithm to select the splitting plane that minimizes the average amount of ambiguity in the choice of the nearest neighbor for the training points. We provide an empirical analysis comparing these two methods against the optimized kd-tree construction for a number of synthetically generated data and query sets. We demonstrate that for clustered data and query sets, these algorithms can provide significant improvements over the standard kd-tree construction for approximate nearest neighbor searching.},

This approach achieves a many-fold speedup over the Press & Rybicki method as implemented in Astropy and is simultaneously many orders of magnitude more accurate. nifty-ls also supports fast evaluation on GPUs via CUDA and integrates with the Astropy Lomb–Scargle interface. nifty-ls is publicly available at https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nifty-ls/ . },

  abstract  = {The statistical properties of least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data are examined. It is shown that, in the least-squares spectrum of gaussian noise, the reduction in the sum of squares at a particular frequency is a X22 variable. The reductions at different frequencies are not independent, as there is a correlation between the height of the spectrum at any two frequencies, f1 and f2, which is equal to the mean height of the spectrum due to a sinusoidal signal of frequency f1, at the frequency f2. These correlations reduce the distortion in the spectrum of a signal affected by noise. Some numerical illustrations of the properties of least-squares frequency spectra are also given. © 1976 D.

  abstract  = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},
