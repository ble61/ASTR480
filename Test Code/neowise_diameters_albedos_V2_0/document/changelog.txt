Changes implemented between Ver 1 and Ver 2 of the NEOWISE asteroid
diameter data table:

-For all objects with provisional designations, we have updated their
 names in all fit tables to reflect the current primary designation as
 of 4 Sep 2018 as assigned by the MPC and published in the relevant
 object naming files.  Objects that have been numbered between the
 previous version and this release have likewise been updated.  

-Physical property tables for near-earth objects and Main Belt
 asteroids published in Nugent et al. (2016), Masiero et al. (2017),
 and Masiero et al. (2018) have been added to the appropriate physical
 property tables.

  New data tables added:
  - 229 NEO fits from Nugent et al. 2016
  - 6148 MBA fits from Nugent et al. 2016
  - 202 NEO fits from Masiero et al. 2017
  - 6867 MBA fits from Masiero et al. 2017
  - 116 NEO fits from Masiero et al. 2018

-Due to a typo in the thermal model code output, fit results for
 objects with fixed beaming parameters were reporting approximations of
 the error on the beaming parameter, not the actual error used for the
 Monte Carlo error analysis.  The BEAMING_PARAM_ERR column has been
 updated to reflect the actual value used for the error analysis.

-In Version 1, a small number of objects appeared in multiple mutually
 exclusive lists (e.g. Main Belt and Trojan).  This occurred when
 objects were initially fit with an orbit in one class (usually Main
 Belt asteroids) and given a designation as such (at which point they
 were included in analysis of Main Belt asteroids and associated
 papers), and then later linked by the Minor Planet Center to other
 observations resulting in a new orbit and new classification.  Orbits
 where the semimajor axis has changed by more than 1 AU between the
 time of fitting and the present orbit solution have been noted as
 such with the label "OrbChange".  In other cases, objects with short
 arcs that had published orbits in the MPC catalog when the fits were
 originally produced now no longer have orbits listed by the MPC.
 These fits have been noted as such with the label "NoOrb".

  Total numbers of objects with changed or removed orbits:
  - 382 MBAs from Mas11
  - 7 MBAs from Mas12
  - 1 Hilda from Gr12a
  - 4 Trojans from Gra11

-In the Nug15 and Nug16 source papers, the lower limit on perihelion
 distance for the Main Belt asteroid tables was set to 1.3 AU instead
 of 1.666 AU.  Additionally, no upper limit on semimajor axis was used
 for filtering.  Thus, those Main Belt tables contain some non-Main
 Belt objects.

-Mainzer et al. (2011b) used the NEATM to see whether the surface
 brightnesses of asteroids and satellites with known diameters could
 be reproduced in order to verify the calibration of the
 then-newly-launched WISE mission's bandpasses for extremely red
 objects. This set of 117 objects was drawn from radar, occultation,
 and spacecraft data. Those fits have a '-' instead of a 'D' in the
 model fit code.  Asteroids have red spectral energy distributions
 (SEDs), and the WISE bandpasses are broad.  Mainzer et al. (2011b)
 sought to verify that the zeropoints and color corrections derived
 for the WISE bandpasses from calibrator stars (which are blue) and
 Active Galactic Nuclei (which tend to be red but can be variable)
 were appropriate for objects with very red SEDs such as asteroids. To
 that end, the differences between model and observed magnitudes were
 plotted vs. the asteroid calibrator objects' sub-solar temperatures
 when their diameters were held fixed to previously published values
 in order to verify that the newly derived color corrections worked
 properly for these asteroids, which are much cooler than stars.
 These fixed-diameter fits were then included in the fit tables of
 Masiero et al. (2011) and Mainzer et al. (2011c) to ensure
 consistency among the NEOWISE team papers.  During the review process
 for the Mainzer et al. (2011b) paper, the referee requested that the
 table be restricted to objects with light curve amplitudes <0.3 mag,
 resulting in the final published table only having 48 listed
 calibration objects.  Due to a clerical error, the team did not
 update the other paper tables, resulting in fixed diameters that did
 not have references to the calibration source.  To better trace the
 provenance of the diameters used for these fits in this data release,
 we have created a separate list of all fits that used a fixed
 diameter, titled "neowise_fixed_diameter_fits", and have included
 a second reference column to provide the source of the diameter.

-The tabulated values in Ver 1 from Masiero et al. (2014) used an
 unfiltered table that had not had the selection cuts as specified in
 the text.  These fits were conducted in the same manner as presented
 in the paper, but did not meet the criterion of having a fitted
 infrared albedo in both short wavelength bands to be included in the
 published table.  Due to this clerical error, 975 fits of 812 objects
 were inadvertently used in the first PDS release to replace fits from
 the original Masiero et al. (2011) fits.  We have reverted these fits
 back to the 2011 values.  Fourteen of these reverted fits used a
 fixed diameter from an external reference source to better constrain
 the other model properties.  They are: (2), (13), (36), (46), (53),
 (54), (84), (105), (134), (313), (336), (345), (2867).  These fits
 have been moved to the table of fixed diameter fits, and references
 to the calibration diameter source are included therein.

-For 20 fits from Mainzer et al. (2014), the Fast-Rotating Model of
 thermal emission was employed.  To better highlight these fits, we
 replace the 'B' fitted beaming flag with an 'F' signifier instead in
 the fit code, and list values of the beaming parameter and beaming
 error as 0.000.  In addition, some objects had incorrect 'I' fit
 codes listed upon table compilation, which have been fixed.

-Nine objects from Mainzer et al. (2014) were inadvertently left out
 of the PDS Ver 1 table.  These have been included in Ver 2.

-The tabulated values in Ver 1 from Grav et al. (2012a) of Hilda
 asteroids did not use the final table presented in the paper due to a
 clerical error.  Correction of this has resulted in minor changes to
 the uncertainties on the fitted parameters of most Hilda fits, and
 the removal of object 2010 MM92 from the table which was not in the
 final published version of the paper.

-Three objects presented in Ver 1 used names based on MPC-published
 tracklet linkages that were later found to be in error and corrected
 by the MPC.  NEOWISE observations of 2010 JE90 were originally linked
 to 2009 HN14 and published in Ver 1 under that name.  That object has
 subsequently been numbered, and the tracklet for 2010 JE90 divorced
 from this object.  2010 JE90 now is a short-arc tracklet with no
 orbit in the MPC database.  NEOWISE observations of 2010 FH106 were
 originally linked to 2011 EU61 and published under that name in Ver
 1.  Subsequent analysis by the MPC has shown that this tracklet
 belongs to asteroid (462971).  The physical property fit is now
 published under the numbered designation, and 2011 EU61 has no
 associated NEOWISE observations and thus does not appear in the PDS
 Ver 2 tables.  Two sets of observations for object 2010 OB91 were
 published in Ver 1.  The observations from Feb 2010 have subsequently
 been linked to (433458) and the fit to those detections is now
 published under that name, while the observations from Jul 2010 are
 correctly listed under that name, but have no orbit in the MPC
 catalog.  It is possible there are additional broken linkages,
 however to our knowledge there is no catalog of broken linkages
 publicly supplied by the MPC to allow us to perform a comprehensive
 search.
