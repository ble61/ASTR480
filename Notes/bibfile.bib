  abstract  = {J. A. Burns and V. S. Safronov (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 165, 403-411, 1973) estimated the damping time scale of rotational wobble for asteroids, and concluded that all asteroid rotations then known should be damped to a state of principal-axis rotation about the axis of maximum moment of inertia. I have reexamined this question in the light of some more recently determined cases of very slow rotation rates and find that for several asteroids, the damping time scale is expected to be considerably longer than the age of the Solar System, implying that these objects may very well exhibit non-principal-axis rotation, which in an extreme case of a large amplitude wobble of a very irregularly shaped body may lead to the appearance of nearly irregular "tumbling" in space. Perhaps most notable in this group is the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. Both radar observations (Ostro et al., Bul. Amer. Astron. Soc. 25, 1126, 1993) and lightcurve observations (M. A. Barucci, J. R. Spencer, personal communications 1993) suggest that Toutatis may indeed be in a more complex state of rotational motion than simple principal-axis rotation. I mention several other examples of objects which might be expected to be in similar states and a couple of examples of lightcurve observations of such objects that appear to support that conclusion. © 1994 Academic Press.

  abstract = { Compared with previous space-borne surveys, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) provides a unique and new approach to observe solar system objects. While its primary mission avoids the vicinity of the ecliptic plane by approximately six degrees, the scale height of the solar system debris disk is large enough to place various small body populations in the field of view. In this paper we present the first data release of photometric analysis of TESS observations of small solar system bodies, focusing on the bright end of the observed main-belt asteroid and Jovian Trojan populations. This data release, named TSSYS-DR1, contains 9912 light curves obtained and extracted in a homogeneous manner, and triples the number of bodies with unambiguous fundamental rotation characteristics, namely where accurate periods and amplitudes are both reported. Our catalog clearly shows that the number of bodies with long rotation periods are definitely underestimated by all previous ground-based surveys, by at least an order of magnitude. },

  abstract  = {None of the approximately 750,000 known asteroids and comets in the Solar System is thought to have originated outside it, despite models of the formation of planetary systems suggesting that orbital migration of giant planets ejects a large fraction of the original planetesimals into interstellar space. The high predicted number density of icy interstellar objects (2.4 × 10-4 per cubic astronomical unit) suggests that some should have been detected, yet hitherto none has been seen. Many decades of asteroid and comet characterization have yielded formation models that explain the mass distribution, chemical abundances and planetary configuration of the Solar System today, but there has been no way of telling whether the Solar System is typical of planetary systems. Here we report observations and analysis of the object 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) that demonstrate its extrasolar trajectory, and that thus enable comparisons to be made between material from another planetary system and from our own. Our observations during the brief visit by the object to the inner Solar System reveal it to be asteroidal, with no hint of cometary activity despite an approach within 0.25 astronomical units of the Sun. Spectroscopic measurements show that the surface of the object is spectrally red, consistent with comets or organic-rich asteroids that reside within the Solar System. Light-curve observations indicate that the object has an extremely oblong shape, with a length about ten times its width, and a mean radius of about 102 metres assuming an albedo of 0.04. No known objects in the Solar System have such extreme dimensions. The presence of 'Oumuamua in the Solar System suggests that previous estimates of the number density of interstellar objects, based on the assumption that all such objects were cometary, were pessimistically low. Planned upgrades to contemporary asteroid survey instruments and improved data processing techniques are likely to result in the detection of more interstellar objects in the coming years.},

  abstract  = { The recent discovery by Pan-STARRS1 of 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua), on an unbound and hyperbolic orbit, offers a rare opportunity to explore the planetary formation processes of other stars and the effect of the interstellar environment on a planetesimal surface. 1I/‘Oumuamua’s close encounter with the inner solar system in 2017 October was a unique chance to make observations matching those used to characterize the small-body populations of our own solar system. We present near-simultaneous g ′, r ′, and J photometry and colors of 1I/‘Oumuamua from the 8.1 m Frederick C. Gillett Gemini-North Telescope and gri photometry from the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope. Our g ′ r ′ J observations are directly comparable to those from the high-precision Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS), which offer unique diagnostic information for distinguishing between outer solar system surfaces. The J -band data also provide the highest signal-to-noise measurements made of 1I/‘Oumuamua in the near-infrared. Substantial, correlated near-infrared and optical variability is present, with the same trend in both near-infrared and optical. Our observations are consistent with 1I/‘Oumuamua rotating with a double-peaked period of 8.10 ± 0.42 hr and being a highly elongated body with an axial ratio of at least 5.3:1, implying that it has significant internal cohesion. The color of the first interstellar planetesimal is at the neutral end of the range of solar system g  −  r and r  −  J solar-reflectance colors: it is like that of some dynamically excited objects in the Kuiper Belt and the less-red Jupiter Trojans. },

  abstract  = {During the formation and evolution of the Solar System, significant numbers of cometary and asteroidal bodies were ejected into interstellar space$^\{1,2\}$. It can be reasonably expected that the same happened for planetary systems other than our own. Detection of such Inter- stellar Objects (ISOs) would allow us to probe the planetesimal formation processes around other stars, possibly together with the effects of long-term exposure to the interstellar medium. 1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua is the first known ISO, discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in October 2017$^3$.The discovery epoch photometry implies a highly elongated body with radii of $\sim 200 \times 20$ m when a comet-like geometric albedo of 0.04 is assumed. Here we report spectroscopic characterisation of 'Oumuamua, finding it to be variable with time but similar to organically rich surfaces found in the outer Solar System. The observable ISO population is expected to be dominated by comet-like bodies in agreement with our spectra, yet the reported inactivity implies a lack of surface ice. We show this is consistent with predictions of an insulating mantle produced by long-term cosmic ray exposure. An internal icy composition cannot therefore be ruled out by the lack of activity, even though 'Oumuamua passed within 0.25 au of the Sun.},

We find that 1I’s colors are       and       , consistent with visible spectra and most comparable to the population of solar system C/D asteroids, Trojans, or comets. We find no evidence of any cometary activity at a heliocentric distance of 1.46 au, approximately 1.5 months after 1I’s closest approach distance to the Sun. Significant brightness variability was seen in the r observations, with the object becoming notably brighter toward the end of the run. By combining our APO photometric time series data with the Discovery Channel Telescope data of Knight et al., taken 20 hr later on 2017 October 30, we construct an almost complete lightcurve with a most probable single-peaked lightcurve period of       . Our results imply a double-peaked rotation period of 8.1 ± 0.02 hr, with a peak-to-trough amplitude of 1.5–2.1 mag. Assuming that 1I’s shape can be approximated by an ellipsoid, the amplitude constraint implies that 1I has an axial ratio of 3.5–10.3, which is strikingly elongated. Assuming that 1I is rotating above its critical break up limit, our results are compatible with 1I having modest cohesive strength and may have obtained its elongated shape during a tidal distortion event before being ejected from its home system. },

  abstract  = { We present observations of the interstellar interloper 1I/2017 U1 (’Oumuamua) taken during its 2017 October flyby of Earth. The optical colors B – V  = 0.70 ± 0.06, V – R  = 0.45 ± 0.05, overlap those of the D-type Jovian Trojan asteroids and are incompatible with the ultrared objects that are abundant in the Kuiper Belt. With a mean absolute magnitude H  V   = 22.95 and assuming a geometric albedo p  V   = 0.1, we find an average radius of 55 m. No coma is apparent; we deduce a limit to the dust mass production rate of only ∼2 × 10 −4 kg s −1 , ruling out the existence of exposed ice covering more than a few m 2 of the surface. Volatiles in this body, if they exist, must lie beneath an involatile surface mantle ≳0.5 m thick, perhaps a product of prolonged cosmic-ray processing in the interstellar medium. The light curve range is unusually large at ∼2.0 ± 0.2 mag. Interpreted as a rotational light curve the body has axis ratio       :1 and semi-axes ∼230 m × 35 m. A ≳6:1 axis ratio is extreme relative to most small solar system asteroids and suggests that albedo variations may additionally contribute to the variability. The light curve is consistent with a two-peaked period ∼8.26 hr, but the period is non-unique as a result of aliasing in the data. Except for its unusually elongated shape, 1I/2017 U1 is a physically unremarkable, sub-kilometer, slightly red, rotating object from another planetary system. The steady-state population of similar, ∼100 m scale interstellar objects inside the orbit of Neptune is ∼10 4 , each with a residence time of ∼10 years. },

  abstract  = {We show that ‘Oumuamua’s excited spin could be in a high-energy long axis mode (LAM) state, which implies that its shape could be far from the highly elongated shape found in previous studies. CLEAN and ANOVA algorithms are used to analyze ‘Oumuamua’s lightcurve using 818 observations over 29.3 days. Two fundamental periodicities are found at frequencies (2.77 ± 0.11) and (6.42 ± 0.18) cycles/day, corresponding to (8.67 ± 0.34) hr and (3.74 ± 0.11) hr, respectively. The phased data show that the lightcurve does not repeat in a simple manner, but approximately shows a double minimum at 2.77 cycles/day and a single minimum at 6.42 cycles/day. ‘Oumuamua could be spinning in either the LAM or short axis mode (SAM). For both, the long axis precesses around the total angular momentum vector with an average period of (8.67 ± 0.34) hr. For the three LAMs we have found, the possible rotation periods around the long axis are 6.58, 13.15, or 54.48 hr, with 54.48 hr being the most likely. ‘Oumuamua may also be nutating with respective periods of half of these values. We have also found two possible SAM states where ‘Oumuamua oscillates around the long axis with possible periods at 13.15 and 54.48 hr. In this case any nutation occurs with the same periods. Determination of the spin state, the amplitude of the nutation, the direction of the total angular momentum vector (TAMV), and the average total spin period may be possible with a direct model fit to the lightcurve. We find that ‘Oumuamua is “cigar-shaped,” if close to its lowest rotational energy, and an extremely oblate spheroid if close to its highest energy state.},

  abstract  = {The discovery 1 of 1I/2017 U1 (1I/'Oumuamua) has provided the first glimpse of a planetesimal born in another planetary system. This interloper exhibits a variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small bodies, such as the P- and D-type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans and dynamically excited Kuiper belt objects 2-7 . 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an axial ratio exceeding 5:1 (refs 1,4,5,8 ). Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 h (refs 4-6,9 ). Here, we analyse all the available optical photometry data reported to date. No single rotation period can explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing non-principal axis rotation, or tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135 and 0.126 h-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of ≳5:1, although the available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and shape. Assuming a body that responds to non-principal axis rotation in a similar manner to Solar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's tumbling is at least one billion years. 1I/'Oumuamua was probably set tumbling within its parent planetary system and will remain tumbling well after it has left ours.},

@article{Drahus2018,
  abstract  = {Models of the Solar System's evolution show that almost all the primitive material leftover from the formation of the planets was ejected to the interstellar space as a result of dynamical instabilities 1 . Accordingly, minor bodies should also be ejected from other planetary systems and should be abundant in the interstellar space 2, giving hope for their direct detection and detailed characterization as they penetrate through the Solar System 3,4 . These expectations materialized on 19 October 2017 ut with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System's discovery of 1I/'Oumuamua 5 . Here, we report homogeneous photometric observations of this body from Gemini North, which densely cover a total of 8.06 h over two nights. A combined ultra-deep image of 1I/'Oumuamua shows no signs of cometary activity, confirming the results from other, less sensitive searches 6-9 . Our data also show an enormous range of rotational brightness variations of 2.6 ± 0.2 mag, larger than ever observed in the population of small Solar System objects, suggesting a very elongated shape of the body. Most significantly, the light curve does not repeat exactly from one rotation cycle to another and its double-peaked periodicity of 7.56 ± 0.01 h from our data is inconsistent with earlier determinations 6,7,10-12 . These are clear signs of a tumbling motion, a remarkable characteristic of 1I/'Oumuamua's rotation that is consistent with a collision in the distant past. Bearing marks of a violent history, this first-known interstellar visitor tells us that collisional evolution of minor body populations in other planetary systems might be common.},

  abstract  = { 1I/’Oumuamua was discovered by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS 1) on 2017 October 19. Unlike all previously discovered minor planets, this object was determined to have eccentricity e  > 1.0, suggesting an interstellar origin. Since this discovery and within the limited window of opportunity, several photometric and spectroscopic studies of the object have been made. Using the measured light curve amplitudes and rotation periods we find that, under the assumption of a triaxial ellipsoid, a density range 1500 <  ρ  < 2800 kg m −3 matches the observations and no significant cohesive strength is required. We also determine that an aspect ratio of 6 ± 1:1 is most likely after accounting for phase-angle effects and considering the potential effect of surface properties. This elongation is still remarkable, but less than some other estimates. },

  abstract = {We present an empirical analysis of data structures for approximate nearest neighbor searching. We compare the well-known optimized kd-tree splitting method against two alternative splitting methods. The first, called the sliding-midpoint method, which attempts to balance the goals of producing subdivision cells of bounded aspect ratio, while not producing any empty cells. The second, called the minimum-ambiguity method is a query-based approach. In addition to the data points, it is also given a training set of query points for preprocessing. It employs a simple greedy algorithm to select the splitting plane that minimizes the average amount of ambiguity in the choice of the nearest neighbor for the training points. We provide an empirical analysis comparing these two methods against the optimized kd-tree construction for a number of synthetically generated data and query sets. We demonstrate that for clustered data and query sets, these algorithms can provide significant improvements over the standard kd-tree construction for approximate nearest neighbor searching.},
